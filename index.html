                <p>
                    I am a second year software engineering student who is minoring in Aerospace.
                    <br>
                    I am interest in embedded programming and the emerging field of IOT, and
                    <br>
                    other low-level programming applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a Mission Operations member of the CalgaryToSpace team, and I am currently working on
                    <br>
                    mission planning, writing lightweight scripts and running orbital simulations for the upcoming
                    <br>
                    launch. I have had one internship of work experience at a small startup company, and am currently

                <p>
                    Outside of school, I enjoy playing the piano, video games, fishing, and working out. I like to dabble
                    <br>
                    around with my Arduino kits and spare electronics, and I am currently working on a project to automate
                    <br>
                    my morning coffee!
